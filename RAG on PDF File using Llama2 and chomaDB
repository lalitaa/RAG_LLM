The donor's identity is typically not disclosed to the recipient or the child born through the donation.\\n\\nOocyte (egg) donor: An oocyte donor is a person who provides an egg for the purpose of ART such as IVF. The donor's identity is typically not disclosed to the recipient or the child born through the donation.\\n\\nIn India, the law related to sperm and oocyte donation is governed by the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Regulations, 2004. According to these regulations, sperm and oocyte donation are allowed in India, but there are certain requirements and procedures that need to be followed.\\n\\nObtaining information from a sperm or oocyte donor in India:\\n\\nAccording to the ART Regulations, 2004, the identity of the donor is not disclosed to the recipient or the child born through the donation. This means that the donor's personal information, such as their name, address, and contact details, is not shared with the recipient or the child.\\n\\nHowever, the regulations do not prohibit the donor from providing information about themselves to the recipient or the child, if they so wish. In other words, the donor has the right to disclose their identity to the recipient or the child, if they want to.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the ART Regulations, 2004, do not provide any specific guidelines or procedures for obtaining information from a sperm or oocyte donor in India. Therefore, the manner of obtaining information from a donor may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.\\n\\nIn practice, some sperm and oocyte banks in India may have their own policies and procedures for obtaining information from donors. These policies and procedures may include requirements for donors to provide certain information, such as their medical history, family medical history, and social and personal information.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the information obtained from a donor is typically used for the purpose of the donation only, and is not shared with any third party without the donor's consent. This means that the recipient or the child born through the donation will not have access to the donor's personal information without the donor's explicit consent.\\n\\nIn summary, the manner of obtaining information in respect of a sperm or oocyte donor in India according to ART law is as follows:\\n\\n* The identity of the donor is not disclosed to the recipient or the child born through the donation.\\n* The donor has the right to disclose their identity to the recipient or the child, if they so wish.\\n* The ART Regulations, 2004, do not provide any specific guidelines or procedures for obtaining information from a sperm or oocyte donor in India.\\n* Some sperm and oocyte banks in India may have their own policies and procedures for obtaining information from donors.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the laws and regulations related to sperm and oocyte donation are subject to change, and it is recommended to consult with a legal professional or a fertility clinic for the most up-to-date information.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Test the Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nWe define a test function, that will run the query and time it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def test_rag(qa, query):\n    print(f\"Query: {query}\\n\")\n    time_1 = time()\n    result = qa.run(query)\n    time_2 = time()\n    print(f\"Inference time: {round(time_2-time_1, 3)} sec.\")\n    print(\"\\nResult: \", result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.124083Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.124403Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.129894Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.124376Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.128863Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initalize the Chain","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"retriever = db.as_retriever()\n\nqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\n    llm=llm, \n    chain_type=\"stuff\", \n    retriever=retriever, \n    verbose=True\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.131079Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.131876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.143878Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.131849Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.142947Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = \"what are the medical equipments for a ART level 1 clinic?\"\ntest_rag(qa, query)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.145126Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.145538Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-18T10:55:07.633058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-18T10:54:42.145513Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-18T10:55:07.632009Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: what are the medical equipments for a ART level 1 clinic?\n\n\n\n\u001b[1m> Entering new RetrievalQA chain...\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6c1c99b903ee42bbba8f036d981d50aa"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"This is a friendly reminder - the current text generation call will exceed the model's predefined maximum length (2048).
